## Key Analysis Questions
1. What is the distribution of average profit by state?
2. Which state is generating the highest average profit, and which is incurring losses?
3. In which age range is the company generating maximum profit?
4. What is the average sales value?
5. What is the average profit value?
6. What is the average discount offered across all transactions?
7. What are the regional quarterly profit trends?
